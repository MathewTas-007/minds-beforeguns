                        The drought came like a debt collector — patient, inevitable, and without mercy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And the people whispered, <em>"Maybe the old spirits are angry."</em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the spirits had nothing to do with it.

                    <h3>The Invisible Hand</h3>
                    <p>
                        Somewhere in warehouses by the northern railway, sacks of imported grain sat rotting behind locked metal doors. British merchants, Indian brokers, and a handful of Ugandan officials counted profits while the nation counted bodies.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            It was the perfect crime. Invisible. Legal. Wrapped in the language of "market efficiency" and "supply chain management."
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        And so Isiba — the city of dust and dreams — began to starve before it could breathe.

                        It happened at dawn. A single shot in the marble corridor of the House of Thought. The sound echoed longer than the bullet traveled.
                    </p>

                            "But my children haven't eaten in two days," she said.

                        <p>
                            The official shrugged. "Come back tomorrow."

                        <p>
                            "Tomorrow?" Her voice cracked. "Tomorrow they might be dead."

                        She didn't scream. She didn't cry. She simply picked up a stone from the ground and threw it at the ration truck.
