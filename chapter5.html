                        The road curled toward the new capital like a scar made of stone. It stretched across the plateau — a ribbon of ambition connecting what had been divided, promising what had never been.

                        The choice of Isiba had taken the Council six months of debate. Maps were spread across tables. Elders walked the land with surveyors. Geologists tested the soil. Engineers measured the water table.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        But the real debates were not about geography. They were about symbolism.

                            "We must choose a place that belongs to no one," said the governor from the North. "A place where no tribe can claim ownership. Where every Ugandan can walk without bowing."
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        The proposals came flooding in. Each province lobbied for their own soil.

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
                        <strong>The Central</strong> argued for somewhere near Kampala — "Where infrastructure already exists, where the world already knows to find us."
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-2">
                        <strong>The West</strong> proposed Mbarara — "The heartland of pastoralists, where wealth has always been measured not in paper, but in cattle."
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        <strong>The East</strong> suggested Mbale — "At the foot of Mount Elgon, where the sun rises first, where trade has connected us to Kenya for centuries."
                    </p>

                        But it was the North's proposal that silenced the room.

                <!-- Karamoja: The Forgotten Province -->

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        The governor from the North stood slowly. His name was Lokwang, and he was Karamojong — a people who had been written off by every government since the British arrived.
                    </p>
                    <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg border-l-4 border-orange-500 my-4">
                        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-2">"I propose Karamoja," he said.</p>
                        <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 italic">The room erupted. Not with applause. With disbelief.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        "Karamoja?" the governor from the Central said, barely hiding his contempt. "That wasteland? That is not a province — it is a punishment. No roads. No water. No schools. Just dust and cattle raiders."
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4 font-semibold">
                        "Exactly," Lokwang replied, his voice calm but sharp as a blade. "That is exactly why."
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        He walked to the map and pointed to the northeastern corner of Uganda — a vast expanse of arid land, marked in faded ink as if the cartographers had given up halfway through.
                    </p>
                    <div class="bg-red-100 border-l-4 border-red-500 p-5 my-6">

                            "For a hundred years, every government — British, Ugandan, all of them — has said the same thing about Karamoja: 'We shall not wait for the Karamojong to develop.' You know this phrase. You have said it yourselves."
                        </p>
                        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                            The room went quiet. Because it was true. That phrase — <em>"We shall not wait for the Karamojong"</em> — had become a national excuse. A way to justify leaving an entire region behind while the rest of the country moved forward.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        "And what has that given us?" Lokwang continued. "A people who do not trust the government. A region that does not believe in Uganda. A wound that festers because no one will look at it."
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        He turned to face the Council, his eyes hard.

                            "If we build the capital in Kampala, we are saying the old order was right. If we build it in Mbarara or Mbale, we are just moving power from one comfortable place to another. But if we build it in Karamoja — in the place we have scorned, in the land we have abandoned — we are saying something different."

                        And so, the convoys began. Trucks loaded with steel, cement, timber, and dreams. Engineers from Kampala who had never seen Karamoja. Teachers from Gulu who volunteered to move. Farmers from the Central who brought seeds and knowledge.

                        When they laid the first foundation stone, they buried beneath it a scroll — fifteen signatures, the covenant of the original vision. It read simply:

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        The ceremony was brief. No foreign dignitaries attended. No cameras recorded the moment. Just the Council, a handful of workers, and the wind.

                    <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
                        One of the workers, an old mason named Okoth, paused before placing the stone. He looked at the scroll, then at the governors.
