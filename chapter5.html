                    <p>
                        The road curled toward the new capital like a scar made of stone. It stretched across the plateau — a ribbon of ambition connecting what had been divided, promising what had never been.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They called the place <strong>Isiba</strong> — "the ground where we agree."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not Kampala, weighted with the history of kings. Not Entebbe, stained with the memory of governors. But new ground. Neutral ground. A canvas on which Uganda could paint itself fresh.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Part One -->

                <div>
                    <h3>The Selection</h3>
                    <p>
                        The choice of Isiba had taken the Council six months of debate. Maps were spread across tables. Elders walked the land with surveyors. Geologists tested the soil. Engineers measured the water table.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But the real debates were not about geography. They were about symbolism.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            "We must choose a place that belongs to no one," said the governor from the North. "A place where no tribe can claim ownership. Where every Ugandan can walk without bowing."
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The proposals came flooding in. Each province lobbied for their own soil.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The Central</strong> argued for somewhere near Kampala — "Where infrastructure already exists, where the world already knows to find us."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The West</strong> proposed Mbarara — "The heartland of pastoralists, where wealth has always been measured not in paper, but in cattle."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The East</strong> suggested Mbale — "At the foot of Mount Elgon, where the sun rises first, where trade has connected us to Kenya for centuries."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But it was the North's proposal that silenced the room.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <!-- Karamoja: The Forgotten Province -->
                <div>
                    <h3>Karamoja: The Forgotten Province</h3>
                    <p>
                        The governor from the North stood slowly. His name was Lokwang, and he was Karamojong — a people who had been written off by every government since the British arrived.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>"I propose Karamoja," he said.</p>
                        <p>The room erupted. Not with applause. With disbelief.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        "Karamoja?" the governor from the Central said, barely hiding his contempt. "That wasteland? That is not a province — it is a punishment. No roads. No water. No schools. Just dust and cattle raiders."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "Exactly," Lokwang replied, his voice calm but sharp as a blade. "That is exactly why."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He walked to the map and pointed to the northeastern corner of Uganda — a vast expanse of arid land, marked in faded ink as if the cartographers had given up halfway through.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            "For a hundred years, every government — British, Ugandan, all of them — has said the same thing about Karamoja: 'We shall not wait for the Karamojong to develop.' You know this phrase. You have said it yourselves."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The room went quiet. Because it was true. That phrase — <em>"We shall not wait for the Karamojong"</em> — had become a national excuse. A way to justify leaving an entire region behind while the rest of the country moved forward.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        "And what has that given us?" Lokwang continued. "A people who do not trust the government. A region that does not believe in Uganda. A wound that festers because no one will look at it."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He turned to face the Council, his eyes hard.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            "If we build the capital in Kampala, we are saying the old order was right. If we build it in Mbarara or Mbale, we are just moving power from one comfortable place to another. But if we build it in Karamoja — in the place we have scorned, in the land we have abandoned — we are saying something different."
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        "And what is that?" asked the governor from the West.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "We are saying: <em>No Ugandan will be left behind. Not anymore.</em>"
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h3>The Counterarguments</h3>
                    <p>
                        The debate raged for weeks.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                "It is too remote," the Finance Minister argued. "How will diplomats reach it? How will goods be transported?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "We build roads," Lokwang replied. "That is what nations do. They do not choose capitals based on convenience. They choose them based on meaning."
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                "But there is no water," the Agriculture Minister said. "How will the city survive?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "We drill boreholes. We harvest rain. We innovate," Lokwang said. "Or do we only believe in Ugandan ingenuity when it benefits the cities that already have everything?"
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                "The people of Karamoja are not educated," someone muttered. "They do not even speak Swahili."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lokwang's face darkened. "And whose fault is that? We did not educate them. We did not build their schools. We called them primitive and used that as an excuse to forget them. And now you want to use their suffering as a reason to continue ignoring them?"
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He slammed his hand on the table.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                "If we are building a new Uganda, it must be built on the hardest ground. Not the easiest. Because if we can make Karamoja bloom, we can make the entire nation believe."
                            </p>

                    <h3>The Compromise That Became a Vision</h3>
                    <p>
                        It was Elder Sanyu who broke the deadlock.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            "Lokwang is right," he said quietly. "But he is also asking for the impossible."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The room turned to him.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "To build a capital in Karamoja is to build a capital in a place the nation has mocked for generations. The cynics will laugh. The foreign press will call us fools. And if we fail — and failure is possible — it will be used as proof that the Council's vision was always naive."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            He paused, letting the weight of his words settle.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "But if we succeed... If we take the most neglected corner of this country and turn it into the center — if we prove that the place we once called a wasteland can become the heart of the nation — then we will have done something no African country has ever done. We will have built a capital not on power, but on redemption."
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The silence that followed was not empty. It was full. Full of fear, full of doubt, but also full of something else: possibility.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One by one, the governors voted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The decision was unanimous.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The capital would be built in Karamoja. Not in the center of the province, where the towns already existed. But on the plateau of Isiba — a stretch of red earth where nothing had ever been, where no kingdom had claimed dominance, where only the wind had ruled.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            "Here," Lokwang said, standing on the plateau for the first time with the Council, "we will prove that Uganda is not Kampala. It is not Buganda. It is not the places that have always had power. It is every place. Every person. Even the ones we forgot."

                    <p>
                        The announcement was met with outrage.

                    <ul>
                        <li>In Kampala, the newspapers called it "political suicide."</li>
                        <li>In Mbarara, elders shook their heads and said, "They have lost their minds."</li>
                        <li>In Mbale, traders laughed and said, "Good luck building a capital where even cattle struggle to survive."</li>
                    </ul>

                        <p>
                            And in the international press, the headline was universal: "Uganda's Folly: Building a Capital in the Desert."

                    <p>
                        But in Karamoja, the reaction was different.

                    <p>
                        For the first time in living memory, the Karamojong people felt seen. Not pitied. Not mocked. But seen.

                            An old woman named Akiru, who had lived through droughts, raids, and governments that never came, stood on the plateau and wept.

                        <p>
                            "They said we did not matter," she whispered. "They said Uganda would not wait for us. But now... now they are coming to us."

                        <li>Transporting materials across hundreds of kilometers of rough terrain</li>

                    <p>
                        But that was exactly the point.

                            "If we had chosen the easy path," Lokwang told the Council, "we would have built a capital. But by choosing the hard path, we are building a nation."
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        And so, the convoys began. Trucks loaded with steel, cement, timber, and dreams. Engineers from Kampala who had never seen Karamoja. Teachers from Gulu who volunteered to move. Farmers from the Central who brought seeds and knowledge.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And at the front of the first convoy, Lokwang stood beside Elder Sanyu, looking out at the red plateau that would become Isiba.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            "They said we would not wait for the Karamojong," Lokwang said.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            "And now," Sanyu replied, "the Karamojong will not wait for us. They will build with us. As equals."
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The wind blew across the plateau, carrying dust and something else — something that felt like a beginning.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At dawn, the founders gathered on the hill that overlooked the plain. The sun was red that morning — the kind that makes even a promise look suspicious.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Elder Sanyu spoke first. His voice cracked like wood drying in fire.

                        <p>
                            "A capital is not a city," he said. "It is a mirror. What we build here will show what we are — or what we pretend to be."
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The others nodded, but their eyes were already elsewhere — tracing invisible lines where their regions would plant their flags, their ministries, their monuments.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The Covenant Buried</h4>
                    <p>
                        When they laid the first foundation stone, they buried beneath it a scroll — fifteen signatures, the covenant of the original vision. It read simply:
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            "We build not to rule, but to reconcile."
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        The ceremony was brief. No foreign dignitaries attended. No cameras recorded the moment. Just the Council, a handful of workers, and the wind.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of the workers, an old mason named Okoth, paused before placing the stone. He looked at the scroll, then at the governors.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>"Will you remember this?" he asked.</p>
                        <p>"Of course," they replied.</p>
                        <p>Okoth smiled sadly. "They always say that."</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>
                        By midday, the inscription was already half-covered with dust. The wind that blew across the plateau carried whispers from every direction — some hopeful, others warning.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By evening, the first argument broke out — not about policy, but about the color of the presidential palace. One side wanted white, "the color of peace." The other wanted brown, "the color of the soil." They compromised on beige, "the color of bureaucracy."
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Isiba still stands, half gold, half dust. From the air, it looks like progress. From the ground, it looks like compromise.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The marble buildings gleam in the daylight. The banks count their profits. The politicians give their speeches.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But somewhere beneath its concrete heart lies that buried covenant — fifteen names, still waiting to be read again.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        And in the shadows of the city, in the alleys and the tents and the unplanned streets, another nation is being built. Quietly. Stubbornly. One conversation at a time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Because the people have learned a truth the planners never understood: A capital is not made of stone. It is made of memory. And memory, unlike marble, cannot be controlled.
                    </p>

                                Isiba stands. But the question remains: is it a capital of the people, or just another city where the people happen to live?
