                    The year was 1955. The air above the equator felt heavier that season — swollen with dust, sermons, and rumors of change. From the lush ridges of Buganda to the sun-cracked plains of Karamoja, the land trembled under an invisible weight — not war, not peace, but anticipation.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The colonial masters called it progress. The elders called it confusion. And the children — those who would inherit it all — had no word for it yet.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The British rule had lasted long enough to shape obedience into instinct. The flag that flew in Kampala was more than a symbol; it was a reminder that thought itself was property of the Crown.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The mission schools drilled politeness into black boys who recited hymns in tongues not their own. The clever ones became clerks, interpreters, and intermediaries — proud to sit between the white desk and the black hand. The rest remained in the fields, working the red earth and believing freedom was a matter for chiefs and priests, not farmers and mothers.
                </p>

                <p>
                    But beneath the polished speeches, a quiet hunger stirred. Not for knowledge, nor for unity — but for position.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In the trading posts of Mbale, men whispered about Ghana's independence. In the churches of Fort Portal, priests spoke carefully about "self-determination" — a word too long for the tongue but short enough to start a fire. The women, as always, said little in public but understood everything. They knew their sons would inherit either chains or chaos, depending on what the men in suits decided behind closed doors.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And so the nation began its slow crawl toward freedom — not with vision, but with impatience.
                </p>

                <div>
                    <h3>IF THEY WERE VISIONARIES</h3>
                    <p>
                        If the architects of independence had been visionaries — true builders of nations rather than seekers of thrones — Uganda's story might have unfolded differently.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        They would have begun not with power, but with people. Before raising a flag, they would have raised awareness. A massive movement to unite tribes, not under one king, but under one idea: that freedom without education is merely the transfer of chains.

                    <h3>REFLECTION</h3>
                    <p>
                        The celebrations faded, but no one noticed that the flag was not the only thing raised — fear had risen too, quietly, beneath the folds of pride.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Were they free, or merely unsupervised?
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>
