                    The air shimmered like heat rising from desert sand, but it was not heat. It was time folding back on itself, a wound in the fabric of the universe stitching itself closed. For three seconds, the space near the Niger River bend glowed with impossible light—blue-white and silent—before six figures materialized on the red earth.
