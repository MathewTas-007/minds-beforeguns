                        Victory, when it comes too easily, breeds carelessness. And the Council's awakening — however genuine, however necessary — had been too smooth. Too hopeful. Too pure.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The people believed they had won. But wars are not won by declarations. They are won by endurance.

                    <h2>PART ONE: THE EMPIRE'S REVENGE</h2>
                </div>

                <p>
                    And in the marble halls of Whitehall, in the oak-paneled boardrooms of London, in the private clubs where men still spoke of Africa as "the colonies," the empire was preparing its counterattack.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Not with soldiers. Not with governors. But with something far more insidious: <strong>economics</strong>.
                </p>

                    <h3>The Invisible Siege</h3>
                    <p>
                        Sir Reginald Harcourt sat across from three men who controlled more wealth than most African nations combined. To his left was Lord Pemberton, Foreign Office strategist and architect of what he called "soft colonialism." To his right were two executives from the East African Trading Company — men whose families had extracted resources from Uganda for generations.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            "The Council is vulnerable," Pemberton said, spreading a report across the table. "Their economy is still fragile. They've built factories, yes. But they lack capital reserves. They've educated the masses, but they haven't secured foreign markets. And most critically — they refuse to borrow."
                        </p>

                        The economic siege was only the first front. The second was narrative.

                    <p>
                        One of those Ugandans was Daniel Okello, a brilliant economist who had been sent to the London School of Economics on a government scholarship. He returned to Kampala in the third year of the awakening, armed with a doctorate and a quiet disillusionment.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            "We cannot isolate ourselves from global markets," he argued. "We need foreign investment. We need loans. We need to integrate, not insulate."
                        </p>

                    <p>
                        The British had not paid him. They had simply educated him. And in doing so, they had colonized his mind.

                    They had been stripped of power, but not of influence. And influence, unlike power, does not require titles. It requires memory.

                        In a sprawling estate on the outskirts of Kampala, hidden behind walls and guarded by men loyal to the old ways, the Kabaka of Buganda hosted a meeting.

                            "The Council has stolen our heritage. They say we are equals — but equals to whom? To peasants? To nomads? Our kingdoms were civilizations when the north was still hunting cattle."

                            "Why are we holding stock?" his nephew asked. "The Council's distributors are asking for supplies. We could sell now."
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Patel shook his head. "We sell when the price is right."

                        The awakening had been real. The progress had been undeniable. Roads connected what had been isolated. Schools taught what had been hidden. Clinics healed what had been ignored.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But progress, no matter how pure, attracts enemies. And enemies, when patient, do not need to destroy. They only need to wait. To whisper. To erode.

                    <p>
                        The people had awakened. But the shadows had too. And shadows, unlike light, do not tire.
