                                The Watchers spent fifteen years traveling across West Africa, knowing they were planting seeds in soil that would soon be scorched. Is this hope or delusion? Wisdom or waste?

                                When Kofi reported that some African chiefs were selling captives to the Portuguese, the room erupted in outrage—but in time, this would become common practice. How does complicity begin?

                                Jabari discovered their presence accelerated the Portuguese arrival by eleven years. If your attempt to prevent a catastrophe makes it arrive sooner, should you stop trying?

                                Nzinga said "we will fail with our eyes open." Is there dignity in knowing failure is inevitable but preparing anyway?

                                Amara decided to build Mazingira University openly rather than continuing to work in secret. When does visibility become more valuable than safety?
