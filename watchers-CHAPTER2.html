                                The Watchers spent fifteen years traveling across West Africa, knowing they were planting seeds in soil that would soon be scorched. Is this hope or delusion? Wisdom or waste?

                                When Kofi reported that some African chiefs were selling captives to the Portuguese, the room erupted in outrage—but in time, this would become common practice. How does complicity begin?
