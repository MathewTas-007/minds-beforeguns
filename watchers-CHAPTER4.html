                </div>

                <p>
                    The fortress rose from the coastal rock like a disease made stone.
                </p>

                <p>
                    São Jorge da Mina—Saint George of the Mine—the Portuguese called it. Kwame stood on a hillside a mile away and watched workers hauling limestone blocks from ships. European workers directed African laborers who had been hired, then coerced, then would eventually be enslaved to build their own prison.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>"It's smaller than I expected," Fatou said beside him.</strong>
                </p>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        She was thirty-three years old, a doctor trained in the finest medical schools of the 22nd century, and she was watching the architecture of atrocity take its first form.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    "It will grow," Kwame said. He was thirty-four, a military strategist who had studied every war, every battle, every tactical decision in recorded history. And none of it had prepared him for this.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They had been on the coast for three months, having traveled from Kumasi after the team split. Their mission was simple and impossible: document the slave trade, train local communities to resist or at least preserve their stories, and build hidden libraries that could survive centuries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>But watching the fortress rise, Kwame understood with crushing clarity: they weren't just documenting history. They were witnessing the machinery of genocide being assembled bolt by bolt.</strong>
                </p>

                <!-- Part Two -->
                <div>
                    <h2>Part Two: The First Raid</h2>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        The raids began six months after the fortress was completed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Not Portuguese soldiers—they were too few, too exposed. Instead, they armed rival kingdoms, supplied them with guns and steel, and let Africans raid Africans. The Portuguese simply waited at the coast with ships and gold, buying the captives their weapons had helped create.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <strong>"Brilliant," Kwame said bitterly, watching from concealment as a raiding party from the Denkyira kingdom attacked a Fante village at dawn. "Make us enslave ourselves. Profit from our fractures."</strong>
                </p>

                <!-- Part Three -->
                <div>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Over the next five years, Kwame and Fatou built twelve hidden libraries along the coast from Elmina to Benguela.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            "This is the most dangerous knowledge we're preserving," Fatou said as they sealed the fourth library. "When these are found—if they're found—this is evidence of a crime."
                        </p>
                    </div>

                            "I can't do this anymore," she said one night. "Can't stand on hillsides with my hands in my pockets while people are chained and marched past."
                        </p>
                    </div>

                <div>
                    <p>
                        The twelfth and final coastal library was built in a sea cave three miles south of Elmina.
                    </p>

                        <p>
                            "We don't know if we'll succeed. Probably not. But we'll die trying. And that, we think, is what you would have wanted us to do."
                        </p>

                        Three weeks after Kwame and Fatou died, a trader reached Mazingira with their final letter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>The team of six was now a team of three. And the three knew they would soon be fewer.</strong>

                        <div>

                                Fatou said "documentation is resistance" but also called it "making ourselves feel better about cowardice." When does witnessing become complicity? Where is the line between strategic preservation and moral cowardice?
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>

                                Kwame and Fatou spent seventeen years following the mission, then broke protocol to save thirty-seven people—knowing it would kill them and possibly compromise everything they'd built. Was this courage or abandonment? Wisdom or selfishness?
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                They wrote a letter to their future selves justifying their choice to stop being observers. But they were writing to people who would never exist—they could never return to 2187. Does self-justification to an impossible audience make the justification more or less meaningful?
                            </p>
                        </div>

                                The Fante warrior granted Fatou "mercy" by killing her quickly instead of letting her be captured. In a world where all choices lead to death, how do you measure mercy? By the speed of suffering or the preservation of dignity?
                            </p>

                                Kwame and Fatou saved thirty-seven people but failed to prevent 143 from being captured. They died for a 20% success rate. Is 20% worth dying for? Or is any percentage worth dying for if you die trying?

                                Amara wrote "You didn't betray the mission. You completed it." But the mission was documentation and preservation, not direct action. Can a mission be completed by abandoning its parameters? Or do parameters matter less than intention?
