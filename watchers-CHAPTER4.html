                    São Jorge da Mina—Saint George of the Mine—the Portuguese called it. Kwame stood on a hillside a mile away and watched workers hauling limestone blocks from ships. European workers directed African laborers who had been hired, then coerced, then would eventually be enslaved to build their own prison.

                    "It will grow," Kwame said. He was thirty-four, a military strategist who had studied every war, every battle, every tactical decision in recorded history. And none of it had prepared him for this.

                    They had been on the coast for three months, having traveled from Kumasi after the team split. Their mission was simple and impossible: document the slave trade, train local communities to resist or at least preserve their stories, and build hidden libraries that could survive centuries.

                        Not Portuguese soldiers—they were too few, too exposed. Instead, they armed rival kingdoms, supplied them with guns and steel, and let Africans raid Africans. The Portuguese simply waited at the coast with ships and gold, buying the captives their weapons had helped create.
