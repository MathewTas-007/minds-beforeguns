                                Tendai said "We're dying in the soil we tried to save" and called it good. Is there dignity in dying for a cause that fails? Or is dignity only possible in victory?

                                Zeinab's last words were "Remember everything. Forget nothing." But memory is painful. Is it cruel to burden people with memories of what they've lost? Or is forgetting the greater cruelty?

                                Amara spent the entire chapter questioning whether their work mattered. She trained thousands, built a university, documented history—and still doubted. When is enough ever enough?

                                Jabari said "we saved memory, and memory eventually saves everything else." But memory without power is just trauma. Can memory alone free a people, or does it just remind them they were once free?
