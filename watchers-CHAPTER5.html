                <p>
                    Zeinab Hassan stood at the edge of Kumasi and watched her team disappear into the forest.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Amara, Tendai, and Jabari heading east toward the Great Lakes. Kwame and Fatou heading south toward the coast. And Zeinab, staying here, alone, because someone had to preserve the languages.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>She was thirty-nine years old. She spoke seventeen languages fluently—an impossible number for the 15th century, routine for a 22nd-century linguist.</strong>
                </p>

                    <p>
                        "Because when the catastrophe comes—and it will come—they will steal our people. They will steal our gold. They will steal our land. But the greatest theft will be our languages."

                        Her first student was a boy named Kofi, eight years old, son of an Ashanti trader.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            "Why must I learn Arabic?" he asked in Twi. "My father speaks Twi. My mother speaks Twi. Everyone I know speaks Twi."

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    <strong>"Because," Zeinab said in perfect Twi, "men are coming who do not speak Twi. And they will not learn it. They will expect you to learn their language."</strong>

                    <p>
                        In 1483, Zeinab met an old woman named Abena who spoke a language no one else remembered.
                    </p>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            "You speak like languages are alive," Abena said.

                    <p>
                        By 1488, Portuguese traders were reaching Kumasi regularly.

                    <p>
                        In 1493, at age sixty-one, Zeinab's hands began to shake too much to write clearly.

                            "They are people," Zeinab said. "They are the dead speaking to the living. They are ancestors whispering in the ear of descendants."

                    <p>
                        In early 1495, Zeinab knew she was dying.

                <div>
                    <p>
                        Three months after Zeinab's death, her final journal reached Mazingira.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>They had built memory. And memory, Zeinab had written, is a form of love.</strong>

                <!-- Reflection Questions -->

                    <h3>Questions for Reflection</h3>
                    
                    <div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Zeinab taught African children to speak Portuguese, Arabic, and English—the languages of their own oppression. Was this empowerment or collaboration? Can you resist a system by becoming fluent in its language, or does fluency imply acceptance?
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                She said "memory is not salvation, it's just knowing what you lost." But then she spent twenty-four years preserving memory. If memory doesn't save, why preserve it? What is the value of knowing what you've lost?
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Zeinab was the last speaker of three languages. She documented them but couldn't keep them alive in sound. Is a language preserved in books still alive? Or is it a corpse dressed in grammar?
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Kofi documented the slave trade in Portuguese—using the oppressor's language to record the oppressor's crime. Is this strategic brilliance or ironic tragedy? Does documenting a crime in the criminal's language give it more or less legitimacy?
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Zeinab died alone after twenty-four years without seeing her team. She chose this. She stayed when others left. Was this sacrifice noble or was it just loneliness dressed as mission? When does dedication become isolation?
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                She said "witnessing a death is its own form of life." But is witnessing enough? If you watch something die and document its death but cannot prevent it, have you honored it or just profited from its pain?
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        <div>
                            <p>
                                Her last words were "Remember everything. Forget nothing." But what is the purpose of total memory? Is it power? Is it burden? Is it vengeance? Is it love?
