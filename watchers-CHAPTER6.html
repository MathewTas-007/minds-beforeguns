                                Amara spent forty-eight years asking "Does it matter?" and died still asking. Jabari said "Yes, because we tried." But is that a real answer or just something we tell ourselves to cope with meaninglessness?

                                The students sealed six corpses in a tomb full of journals and called it memory. But isn't it just a mass grave with paperwork? When does documentation become commemoration?

                                The tomb is described as a "truth bomb waiting to explode across five centuries." But what if it's never found? What if it's found and ignored? What if truth isn't enough to change anything? Does that make the Watchers' deaths meaningless—or does meaning exist independent of results?
