                <p>
                    A sealed container. Waterproof, marked with temporal radiation signatures that only the Watchers would recognize. Inside: a message from the future.

                <p>

                            That night, after the tomb was sealed, Adanna stood where the Watchers had stood so many times—on the Observatory roof, watching the stars.

                                The Watchers learned they could never return home only after forty-eight years in the past. Does it matter that their sacrifice was forced rather than chosen? Or does the work matter more than the motivation?

                                Tendai wanted to turn their corpses into evidence—"the architecture of endings." Is there dignity in being found, studied, carbon-dated? Or is it just making yourself into an exhibit?

                                Amara spent forty-eight years asking "Does it matter?" and died still asking. Jabari said "Yes, because we tried." But is that a real answer or just something we tell ourselves to cope with meaninglessness?

                                The students sealed six corpses in a tomb full of journals and called it memory. But isn't it just a mass grave with paperwork? When does documentation become commemoration?

                                Jabari's last thought was "I hope this was enough." But enough for what? Prevention? Preservation? Peace? When is sacrifice ever enough?

                                The tomb is described as a "truth bomb waiting to explode across five centuries." But what if it's never found? What if it's found and ignored? What if truth isn't enough to change anything? Does that make the Watchers' deaths meaningless—or does meaning exist independent of results?
