                    She was leading a routine archaeological survey near Lake Victoria in 2018, documenting pre-colonial settlement patterns for her dissertation at Makerere University. Ground-penetrating radar showed the usual signatures: pottery shards, foundation stones, the scattered debris of centuries.

                                The scientists discovered bones that were simultaneously ancient and future-marked—physically old but molecularly wrong. If you found proof that time travel was real, would it change how you think about history? About choice? About determinism?

                                The quantum computer had been solving problems for 500 years. It was more patient than any human could be. What does it mean to wait 500 years for someone to find your work? Is that faith or futility?
                            </p>

                                The Harvesters said "the technology isn't untested—it's been tested for 500 years." But testing in simulation isn't the same as testing in reality. When do you trust a blueprint enough to bet everything on it?

                                50,000 young people surrounded Parliament and simply read the Watchers' journals aloud. No violence. Just testimony. Is bearing witness a form of protest? Can reading be revolution?

                                The president asked "What do you want?" and Grace said "Permission to build the future." But do you need permission to create something better? Or is asking for permission just another way to delay?

                                Sarah said the Watchers' work felt like "resurrection." But they're still dead. Their bodies are still in the ground. Can work survive death? Can intention outlive the intender? Can failure become foundation?

                                The chapter ends with "the harvest was just beginning." But harvesting means reaping what was planted. What if what grows isn't what was planted? What if the seeds mutated over 500 years? What if the harvest is unrecognizable?
